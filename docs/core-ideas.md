## Core ideas

* Currency symbols and Units:
	* Currency ID: WLF
	* Currency symbol:
	    * Unicode: ⒲ (#\parenthesized_latin_small_letter_w)
	    * ASCII: (w)
	* 1 mWLF = ⒲ 0.001
	* 1 μWLF = ⒲ 0.000001
* Local Web-based Wallet:
    * Faster development time
    * Wallets encrypted by default
    * Easily create and manage multiple local wallets
    * Reduce dependencies
    * Live-updating, using JS templates such as handlebars, angular, or react
* Encrypted blockchain, tracker, and router
	* Transactions validated randomly and anonymously
* Randomized mining using ISAAC-64 algorithm
	* proof-of-work: all mining attempts stored in the blockchain with block id, cannot be reused
	* proof-of-origin: every coin is verifiable by source and transaction history
